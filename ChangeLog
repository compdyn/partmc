2.2.1 - XXXX-XX-XX

  * De-duplicate error codes.

2.2.0 - 2012-02-25

  * No longer need to specify size bins for particle simulations
    (adaptive binning occurs automatically).

  * Coagulation with negative weightings is accelerated.

  * Added sampled input mode type.

  * Parallel `n_part` is now total computational particles over all
    processors, not per-processor.

  * No longer need to specify weight for particle simulations (a mixed
    number/mass weighting is always used and adapts automatically).

2.1.5 - 2012-01-30

  * Fix bug causing erroneous `n_orig_part` entries.

2.1.4 - 2011-08-15

  * Error if running in parallel with `do_parallel` false.

2.1.3 - 2011-07-02

  * Fix `n_source` bug in `aero_data` (broke `condense` test).

2.1.2 - 2011-06-28

  * Update documentation to include source code.

2.1.1 - 2011-06-22

  * Fix documentation about `restart` and `gas_data`/`aerosol_data`.

2.1.0 - 2011-05-17

  * Include `solar_zenith_angle` in output files when using MOSAIC.

  * Added source-oriented capability for aerosol particles.

2.0.0 - 2011-01-13

  * Parallel implementations based on remote particle access.

  * Added restart capability from NetCDF state files.

  * Added partmc.py library for python-based analysis of PartMC output
    files.

  * Reimplemented water condensation to be much faster and also correct.

  * Nucleation added with parameterization due to Kuang, McMurray, et al.

  * Weighted particles, with full support for coagulation and MOSAIC.

  * Changed to Poisson sampling for coagulation test number.

  * Input and output now use diameter everywhere rather than radius.

  * `urban_plume2` test-case added, as described in the paper
     <http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JD013616>.

1.2.0 - 2009-06-15

  * Output of full per-particle data in NetCDF format.

  * `urban_plume` test-case added, as described in the paper
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JD011073>.

  * Build system switched to `cmake`.

  * Automated test suite added (`make test`).

1.1.0 - 2008-02-17

  * Internal reorganization to use Fortran 90 derived types for the
    data structures.

  * Integration with the MOSAIC gas- and aerosol-chemistry code.

  * Output is in binary NetCDF format.

  * Parallel implementation using 1D mixing.

1.0.0 - 2007-02-26

  * First release, including hierarchical coagulation and full water
    condensation.
