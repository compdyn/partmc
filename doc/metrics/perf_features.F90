!! Todo check if this file is correct or re-organize it in some way (After finishing dev tutorial)

!! todo put here the performance relevant work (Relevant implementations
!! like multi-cell and the speedup achieved (GPU that is already explained
!! in the tutorial can be like a section of the scalability speedup cpu/gpu
!! and the speedup achieved with other implementations, including "failed"
!! implementations that didn't achieved speedup but who knows, maybe in the future
!! someone discover why them are not working or how to improve the module
!! basing in this optimization)

!! todo include a reasoning of if the CPU version was optimized already (mostly yes, but
!! not at his maximum, and GPU can give more speedup in this type of problems because
!! references and multicells approach)
