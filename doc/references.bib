abstract = {A detailed and extended chemical mechanism describing tropospheric aqueous phase chemistry (147 species and 438 reactions) is presented here as Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism (CAPRAM) 2.4 (MODAC mechanism). The mechanism based on the former version 2.3 [ Herrmann et al., 2000] contains extended organic and transition metal chemistry and is formulated more explicitly based on a critical review of the literature. The aqueous chemistry has been coupled to the gas phase mechanism Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Modeling (RACM) [ Stockwell et al., 1997], and phase exchange accounted for using the resistance model of Schwartz [1986]. A method for estimating mass accommodation coefficients ({\&}{\#}945;) is described, which accounts for functional groups contained in a particular compound. A condensed version has also been developed to allow the use of CAPRAM 2.4 (MODAC mechanism) in higher-scale models. Here the reproducibility of the concentration levels of selected target species (i.e., NO x , S(IV), H2O2, NO3, OH, O3, and H+) within the limits of ± 5{\%} was used as a goal for eliminating insignificant reactions from the complete CAPRAM 2.4 (MODAC mechanism). This has been done using a range of initial conditions chosen to represent different atmospheric scenarios, and this produces a robust and concise set of reactions. The most interesting results are obtained using atmospheric conditions typical for an urban scenario, and the effects introduced by updating the aqueous phase chemistry are highlighted, in particular, with regard to radicals, redox cycling of transition metal ions and organic compounds. Finally, the reduced scheme has been incorporated into a one-dimensional (1-D) marine cloud model to demonstrate the applicability of this mechanism.},

abstract = {This chapter describes the manner in which gas-phase chemistry is treated in the Models-3 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system. The CMAQ system currently includes two chemical mechanisms --RADM2 and CB4 --with plans to incorporate a third --the SAPRC97 mechanism --in the near future. Each of these mechanisms is described, and the manner in which the first two are linked to the aqueous chemistry and aerosol formation processes is discussed. Enhanced isoprene chemistry that has been included in the RADM2 mechanism is also described, and procedures for entering new chemical mechanisms in the CMAQ system are addressed. The representation of reaction kinetics in the CMAQ system and the numerical modeling of gas-phase chemistry are also presented. The CMAQ system currently employs two numerical solvers, SMVGEAR and a variant of the QSSA method. The numerical procedures used in each are presented, and the relative computational efficiencies of each on different computing platforms are noted.},

@article{Jacobson1996,
abstract = {A numerical method to solve chemical equilibrium equations and a method of coupling the equilibrium calculations to nonequilibrium growth and evaporation are discussed. The equilibrium program solves any number of equations for gas, aqueous, ionic, and solid equilibrium concentrations over large spatial grids and particle size grids. It also simultaneously computes electrolyte mean mixed activity coefficients and aerosol liquid water content. Mean mixed activity coefficient calculations require mean binary activity coefficient information. Temperature-dependent mean binary activity coefficient polynomials were constructed using mean binary activity coefficient data at 298 K, apparent molal enthalpy data, and apparent molal heat capacity data. The equilibrium solver is mole and charge conserving, requires iteration, but always converges. Solutions to the equilibrium equations are used for two purposes. The first is to estimate surface vapor pressures over particles containing a solution and/or a solid phase. Such vapor pressures are then applied in gas-aerosol transfer equations. The second is to estimate intraparticle composition and size immediately after gas-aerosol transfer.},

@article{Marcolli2005,
abstract = {Water activities of a series of polyol/water systems were measured with an AquaLab dew point water activity meter at 298K. The investigated polyols with carbon numbers from n=2-7 are all in liquid state at room temperature and miscible at any molar ratio with water. In aqueous solutions with the same molar concentration, the diols with lower molecular weight lead to lower water activities than those with higher molecular weights. For diols with four or more carbon atoms, the hydrophilicity shows considerable differences between isomers: The 1,2-isomers - consisting of a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic part - bind less strongly to water than isomers with a more balanced distribution of the hydroxyl groups. The experimental water activities were compared with the predictions of the group contribution method UNIFAC: the model predictions overestimate the water activity of water/polyol systems of substances with two or more hydroxyl groups and can not describe the decreased binding to water of isomers with hydrophobic tails. To account for the differences between isomers, a modified UNIFAC parameterization was developed, that allows to discriminate between three types of alkyl groups depending on their position in the molecule. These new group interaction parameters were calculated using water activities of alcohol/water mixtures. This leads to a distinctly improved agreement of model predictions with experimental results while largely keeping the simplicity of the functional group approach.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient model to calculate gas/aerosol partitioning of semivolatile inorganic aerosol components has been developed for use in global atmospheric chemistry and climate models. We introduce an approximate method for the activity coefficient calculation that directly relates aerosol activity coefficients to the ambient relative humidity, assuming chemical equilibrium. We demonstrate that this method provides an alternative for the computationally expensive iterative activity coefficient calculation methods presently used in thermodynamic gas/aerosol models. The gain of our method is that the entire system of the gas/aerosol equilibrium partitioning can be solved noniteratively, a substantial advantage in global modeling. We show that our equilibrium simplified aerosol model (EQSAM) yields results similar to those of current state-of-the-art equilibrium models.},

abstract = {A flexible mixing rule is presented which allows the calcn. of activity coeffs. of org. compds. in a multi-component aq. soln. Based on the same fitting methodol. as a previously published inorg. model (Partial Differential Fitted Taylor series Expansion; PD-FiTE), org. PD-FiTE treats interactions between binary pairs of solutes with polynomials of varying order. The numerical framework of org. PD-FiTE is not based on empirical observations of activity coeff. variation, rather a simple application of a Taylor Series expansion. Using 13 example compds. extd. from a recent sensitivity study, the framework is benchmarked against the UNIFAC model. For 1000 randomly derived concn. ranges and 10 relative humidities between 10 and 99 {\%}, the av. deviation in predicted activity coeffs. was calcd. to be 3.8{\%}. While compd. specific deviations are present, the median and inter-quartile values across all relative humidity range always fell within ±20{\%} of the UNIFAC value. Comparisons were made with the UNIFAC model by assuming interactions between solutes can be set to zero within PD-FiTE. In this case, deviations in activity coeffs. as low as -40{\%} and as high as +70{\%} were found. Both the fully coupled and uncoupled org. PD-FiTE are up to a factor of ≈12 and ≈66 times more efficient than calling the UNIFAC model using the same water content and ≈310 and ≈1800 times more efficient than an iterative model using UNIFAC. The use of PD-FiTE within a dynamical framework is presented, demonstrating the potential inaccuracy of prescribing fixed neg. or pos. deviations from ideality when modeling the evolving chem. compn. of aerosol particles.

abstract = {This paper describes and evaluates a new Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC), with a special focus on addressing the long-standing issues in solving the dynamic partitioning of semivolatile inorganic gases (HNO3, HCl, and NH3) to size-distributed atmospheric aerosol particles. The coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE) for dynamic gas-particle mass transfer are extremely stiff, and the available numerical techniques are either very expensive or produce oscillatory solutions. These limitations are overcome in MOSAIC with a new dynamic gas-particle partitioning module, which is coupled to an efficient and accurate thermodynamics module. The algorithm includes a new concept of “dynamic pH,” a novel formulation for mass transfer to mixed-phase and solid particles, and an adaptive time stepping scheme, which together hold the key to smooth, accurate, and efficient solutions of gas-particle partitioning over the entire relative humidity range. MOSAIC is found to be in excellent agreement with a benchmark version of the model that uses a rigorous solver for integrating the stiff ODEs. The steady-state MOSAIC results for monodisperse aerosol test cases are also in excellent agreement with those obtained with the benchmark equilibrium model AIM. Moreover, the CPU times required for fully dynamic solutions by MOSAIC per size bin per 5 min intervals (typical 3-D model time steps) are similar to those for bulk equilibrium solutions by the computationally efficient but relatively less accurate model ISORROPIA. These results show that MOSAIC is extremely efficient without compromising accuracy, and is therefore highly attractive for use in air quality and regional/global aerosol models.},
