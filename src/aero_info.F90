  !! For each particle that is removed from the particle population
  !! the aero_info_t structure gives the ID of the removed particle
  !! and the action (dilution, coagulation, emission, etc) that caused
  !! the removal. The action must be one of the AERO_INFO_* parameters
  !! in the pmc_aero_info module. If the action is AERO_INFO_COAG then
  !! the other_id field will store the ID of the particle that was
  !! produced by the coagulation.
  !!
  !! Coagulation always occurs between two particles and the resulting
  !! particle takes the ID of one of the two original particles, or a
  !! new ID. If either of the coagulating particles does not have its
  !! ID inherited by the new particle then it will be recorded in an
  !! \c aero_info_t structure. If the ID of the new coagulated
  !! particle is the same as one of the coagulating particles then it
  !! is not considered to have been lost and is not recorded in an
  !! aero_info_t structure.
