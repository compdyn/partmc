Immersion freezing Test-case
==================================
The initial condition is an internally mixed INPs in a constant
temperature process. All particles initially immersed in water,
with wet diameter of ~2.15 um in average, and dry diameter 
of 1 um in average. The log-std of wet and dry diameter is 0.5.
All particles contain an insoluble INP, with 50% of surface 
covered by illite, and 50% of surface by Fe2O3. The temperature 
is -20 degrees celsius.

The theoretical frozen fraction results are calculated using 
the equation (3.40) in Tang 2024 (https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/131711).
