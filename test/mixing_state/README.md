# Mixing state index test case

This test computes the mixing state index chi for a known particle population. The population consists of two monodisperse subpopulations (P1 and P2) with three chemical species (A, B, C, and D).

Tests are run with different subsets of the species grouped in different ways, all with mass-weighted chi.
