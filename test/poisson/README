Poisson Sample Test
===================

This test generates samples from the Poisson random number generator
used in the main code. The resulting sampled distribution is plotted
against the analytical expression for the Poisson PDF. The Poisson
generator used at the moment is only approximate, so the two plots
should be similar but not identical. The PDFs are computed for several
different values of the rate parameter.
