Weighting Test-case
===========================================

This test uses the various aerosol weighting types on a single
scenario to show that the results are the same between all the 
different options. There are the following configurations:

- run_part_nummass_source.spec: source class (n_class=3) with number and mass weighting (n_group=2)
- run_part_flat_source.spec: source weighting (n_class=3) with number weighting (n_group=1)
- run_part_flat.spec: single weight class (n_class=1) with number weighting (n_group=1)
- run_part_numass.spec: single weight class (n_class=1) with number and mass weighting (n_group=2)
- run_part_flat_specified: initial+background class and emission class (n_class=2)
     with flat weighting (n_group=1)
- run_part_nummass_specified: initial+background class and emission class (n_class=2)
     with number and mass weighting (n_group=2)
- run_exact.spec: exact solution
